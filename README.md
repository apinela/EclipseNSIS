# EclipseNSIS

This project is a fork of the original EclipseNSIS at http://eclipsensis.sf.net. 

_"EclipseNSIS is a plugin for the Eclipse platform which enables editing, compiling and testing Nullsoft Installer (NSIS) scripts. The EclipseNSIS InstallOptions Editor plugin is an add-on to EclipseNSIS which enables editing of InstallOptions scripts."_ -- http://eclipsensis.sourceforge.net/index.shtml

The repository root is a selective snapshot of the original EclipseNSIS CVS modules HEAD (eclipsensis.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/eclipsensis) as of 2014-08-13 including only the necessary source files to build the project.

The purpose of this project was to make EclipseNSIS plugin compatible with my own development tool chain including the latest Windows, Java and Eclipse versions at the time. The code is not systematically tested and changes may have introduced new bugs and removed existing functionality.

Compared to the official EclipseNSIS release 0.9.8.1 this project adds support for:

*   Eclipse 2021-06 (4.20.0)
