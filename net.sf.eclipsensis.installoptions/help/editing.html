<h1>Editing InstallOptions Scripts</h1>
<p>The EclipseNSIS InstallOptions Editor plugin provides two editors for working with InstallOptions scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="designeditor.html">Design Editor</a></li>
<li><a href="sourceeditor.html">Source Editor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Switching between editors can
be accomplished using the <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Switch Editor" title="Switch Editor" src="images/switch.gif"> Switch Editor menuitem available in
the <span style="font-style: italic;">InstallOptions </span>menu on the main menubar, or by pressing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">F12</span> key. Changes made in an editor are reflected in the other editor after a switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2>InstallOptions Script File Format</h2>

<p>InstallOptions scripts are in INI file format, hence both editors
are registered to work with INI files (*.ini extension). The Design
Editor is designated as the default.The INI file format which is supported by EclipseNSIS is as
defined in the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit. The primary characteristics of this format is as follows: </p>
<ol>
<li>The file consists of
sections, each containing zero or more keys. Section names and keys
must be defined on a single line- no line continuations are
supported.</li>
<li>Acceptable spacing characters in a line are Space (ASCII code 32) and Tab (ASCII code 9).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Lines are terminated by a CR (ASCII code 13) or LF (ASCII code 10) character. If
CR+LF or LF+CR appear consecutively, they count as a single line terminator, generating
one line, not two lines. A sequence consisting of CR+LF+CR+LF would however result in two
lines, not one line.</li>
<li>A Section name is enclosed
in square brackets, with the opening bracket being the first
non-spacing character in the line. Any leading or trailing spacing
characters around the Section name inside the square brackets are
discarded.</li>
<li>Keys consist of name and a
value separated by an equals sign (ASCII code 61) optionally surrounded
by spacing characters which are discarded. The Key name starts with the
first non-spacing character in the line.</li>
<li>Any leading or trailing spacing characters in the Key value are discarded. If they are to be retained
then the key value should be enclosed using the quote character (ASCII
code 34). If the entire key value is quoted, then the quote characters
are stripped from the key value. However, if any non-spacing characters
exist either before or after the quote character, then the quote
characters are included in the key value.</li>
<li>Numerical key values may be specified either in decimal or hexadecimal format. Hexadecimal values should be prefixed with "0x".</li>
<li>Comments are introduced by a semicolon character (ASCII code 59), which must be the first non-spacing character in a line.
Comments terminate at the end of the line.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, CR, LF, Tab and backslash (ASCII code 92) characters can be specified in key values by escaping them with a
backslash character, i.e., "\r", "\n", "\t" and "\\", respectively for the following cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Label control type - Text key value</li>
<li>Text control type - State key value (when MULTILINE flag is set)</li>
<li>All control types - ValidateText key value</li>
</ol>
